## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the website in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After downloading, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the website in your default browser, watch for changes to core website files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp html` minifies the HTML files
- `gulp img` compress image files

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
